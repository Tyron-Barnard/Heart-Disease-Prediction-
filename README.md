# Heart Disease Prediction App

## Overview
This project is a web-based application developed using Streamlit, designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. The app utilizes a machine learning model trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset to provide predictions.

## Features
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive visualizations of the dataset to explore the distribution of various health parameters.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict the presence of heart disease based on user input.
- **User Input:** Allows users to input their health parameters through a user-friendly interface to receive a prediction.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd heart-disease-prediction-app

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the app, execute the following command in the project directory:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

The app will start and open in your default web browser. You can interact with the app by inputting your health parameters and receiving a prediction.

## Dataset
The app uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains 14 attributes related to heart disease. The dataset is available in the data directory as heart.csv.
